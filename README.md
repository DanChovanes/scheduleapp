# scheduleapp
Spring Boot project to return a view containing a college schedule. Made this project in hopes of learning Thymeleaf, Docker, and AWS.

Two endpoints, root returns the full schedule, /day returns the daily schedule. Used bootstrap elements because writing a bunch of CSS was not the point of this project.
